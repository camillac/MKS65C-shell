# CAMILLA'S WONDERFUL SHELL
## Features:
* prompt containing username + path in COLOR
* runs basic bash commands (ex. ls, ls -al, cat, etc.)
* allows for extra white space when running processes
* `cd` + `exit`
   - can `cd ~` or `cd` (<- no file path), will cd to home directory
* semi-colon process separation
* redirection using "<" and ">" (works with multiple ">"'s or "<"'s, can not use both at the same time)
* pipes (only 1 though)

## In Progress/Future Features:
* multiples pipes
* fix redirection bugs
* tab completion <3
* up + down arrow history stuff

## Failed Features:
* N/A, everything's working! (hopefully)

## Bugs and Stuff
* can not use "<" and then ">" in the same line
* unclear whether or not ">" and "<" (in that order) in the same line works or not
* can not use redirection and pipes in the same line
* when redirecting a test file to ./a.out to test the functionality, it runs through all the processes but prints the prompt repeatedly afterwards
* ex. commands that don't work as they should: `ls > >`, `ls |'
* maybe more (?)

## Functions:
* **parse_args** - `char ** parse_args(char * line, char * c)`
   - arguments:
      - char * line : line of input from the terminal
      - char * c    : the character the line is being separated by
   - return value:
      - char ** - returns string array of each argument in the line
   - what it does:
      - separates each argument in a string and returns all the arguments as a string array
      
* **userid** - `char * userid()`
   - arguments:
      - n/a
   - return value:
      - char * - returns the user id
   - what it does:
      - gets userid from struct stat and returns it
      
* **replace_one** - `char* replace_one(char* line, char what, char* with)`
   - arguments:
      - char * line : string that contains character you want to change
      - char what   : the character you want to change
      - char * with : the string you want to replace the character with
   - return value:
      - char * - returns the new string
   - what it does:
      - replaces a character in a string with a string
      
* **trim** - `char* trim(char* to_trim)`
   - arguments:
      - char * to_trim : the string you want to trim
   - return value:
      - char * - returns the new string
   - what it does:
      - trims empty spaces off the edges of a string
      
* **cd_exit** - `void cd_exit(char ** args)`
   - arguments:
      - char ** args : array of arguments in the line
   - return value:
      - void
   - what it does:
      - handles the cd or exit command
      
* **redir_sin** - `int redir_sin(char * line)`
   - arguments:
      - char * line : line of input
   - return value:
      - int - returns 0 for successful, -1 for error
   - what it does:
      - redirects for "<" symbol
      
* **redir_sout** - `int redir_sout(char * line)`
   - arguments:
      - char * line : line of input
   - return value:
      - int - returns 0 for successful, -1 for error
   - what it does:
      - redirects for ">" symbol
      
* **pipes** - `int pipes(char * line)`
   - arguments:
      - char * line : line of input
   - return value:
      - int - returns 0 for successful, -1 for error
   - what it does:
      - pipes the stdout of one process to the stdin of another
      
* **reg** - `int reg(char * line)`
   - arguments:
      - char * line : line of input
   - return value:
      - int - returns 0 for successful, -1 for error
   - what it does:
      - runs the individual processes

* **semi_colon** - `int semi_colon(char * line)`
   - arguments:
      - char * line : line of input
   - return value:
      - int - returns 0 for successful, -1 for error
   - what it does:
      - separates processes by semicolons

* **get_line** - `void get_line(char * line)`
   - arguments:
      - char * line : string in which to store the input
   - return value:
      - void
   - what it does:
      - gets the input from the terminal and stores it in a string

* **main** - `int main()`
   - arguments:
      - n/a
   - return value:
      - int - returns 0 for successful, -1 for error
